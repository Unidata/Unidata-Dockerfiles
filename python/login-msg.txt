Welcome to the Unidata Python Docker environment.

To start a Jupyter notebook:

ipython notebook --ip=* --no-browser

for your convenience, this command has been aliased to 'ip'

To navigate to this notebook in your browser, you will enter a URL that looks
something like this https://[ip address]:[port]. For example,

http://192.168.99.101:9321/

If running this Docker container with docker-machine, you can run the command:

docker-machine ip

to discover the IP address of the container.
